# Catchy Tune made in Unity

This game is a replica of the minigame Catchy Tune for the 3ds game "Rhythm Paradise Megamix" made in Unity. All the sprites are redrawn by me, also tried to recreate the same feel when you play the original game. Hope you like it!

You can play it on [itch.io](https://jesushf.itch.io/catchy-tune)!
